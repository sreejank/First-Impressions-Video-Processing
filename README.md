# First-Impressions-Video-Processing

This code was written to analyze short "talking head" videos for a high school project. Specifically, it uses the OpenCV library to process the video and calculate the Information entropy of a person's body shift, eye gaze, body tilt/posture, and language.

When we meet another person, we have the ability to make a quick first impression evaluation of 
their character traits. These evaluations are driven by our observations of others’ visual and
linguistic social cues. Although this evaluation is typically very subjective, an objective analysis
of these behavioral cues may be able to predict these evaluations. These videos were shown to fifty human participants in a survey that asks about participants’ first impressions for various personality traits. Multiple significant correlations between visual/linguistic entropies and survey responses were found, including face shift entropy significantly correlated with percieved leadership-like qualities (R=.67, P=.048) and linguistic entropy significantly correlated with extrovertedness (R=0.588, P=.026), showing that the entropy of various social cues are correlated with how one's personality is perceived by others.
